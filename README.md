## Project Title: **Machine Learning Algorithms for Detecting Mental Stress in College Students**

## Abstract:
This project focuses on predicting and mitigating mental stress among college students using machine learning algorithms. The study leverages a dataset collected through a stress survey validated by medical experts, with 843 participants aged 18-21 years. Seven machine learning algorithms were employed, with Support Vector Machines (SVM) achieving the highest accuracy of 95%.
